# Copy Paste Modules

Copy and paste modules mod for Factorio. [Factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CopyPasteModules).


## Version

Current version in compatible with Factorio 2.0.
See the [changelog](https://github.com/kajacx/CopyPasteModules/blob/master/changelog.md) for more information.
Thanks to brandon942 for fixing the mod for 2.0 <3


## How to use

First, place some modules into a machine, and then copy that machine's settings (by shift + right click)
into another machine (shift + left click) and voila, the modules are copied (inserted from the player's inventory) as well!

The inserted modules will be sorted in the same order. You can also copy from a machine with no modules to remove all modules.

If the player doesn't have enough modules, a logistic request can be automatically created (turned on by default)
to fill those modules from the logistic network. Since 2.0, this will also sort the modules in the same order.


## Settings

 - #### Enable when copying settings
Copy modules (insert from player's inventory) together with entity settings (when shift-clicking).

 - #### Create logistic request
Create logistic request when the player does not have enough modules on them.

 - #### Copy modules from blueprint
Currently does nothing, but inserting and changing modules now works in vanilla. Not removing thogugh, see here:
